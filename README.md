# Welcome to My Engineering Cursus Repository

Hello, I'm Florian Cliquet, a future student in the ESIR Info program. As of May 2024, I am currently in CUPGE2, and next year I'll be starting ESIR 1. Therefore, the data for ESIR 2 and 3 will take some time to be fully developed and valuable.

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of all the materials, projects, and resources I've used and created throughout my engineering studies. It is designed to be a valuable resource for current and future students of ESIR. The repository is organized into three main folders, corresponding to each year of the ESIR program:

### Folder Structure
- **ESIR 1**: First-year resources, including coursework, projects, and reference materials.
- **ESIR 2**: Second-year resources, featuring advanced coursework, hands-on projects, and useful notes.
- **ESIR 3**: Third-year resources, encompassing specialized projects, thesis work, and professional preparation materials.

### What's Inside
- **Course Materials**: Lecture notes, textbooks, and supplementary readings.
- **Projects**: Code, reports, and presentations from various projects.
- **Exams and Solutions**: Past exams and solutions for practice and review. (maybe)
- **Guides and Tips**: Advice on navigating the ESIR program, study tips, and career guidance.
- **Tools and Resources**: Software tools, libraries, and other resources that are beneficial for engineering students.

### Purpose
The goal of this repository is to create a comprehensive and organized reference that will help ESIR students excel in their studies and prepare for their future careers. Whether you are just starting out or are in your final year, you'll find valuable information and tools that can aid in your academic and professional development.

Feel free to explore, use, and contact me for any question about this repository.
