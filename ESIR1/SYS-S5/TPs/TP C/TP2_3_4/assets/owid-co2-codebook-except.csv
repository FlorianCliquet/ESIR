consumption_co2,"Annual consumption-based emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), measured in million tonnes. Consumption-based emissions are national or regional emissions which have been adjusted for trade (i.e. territorial/production emissions minus emissions embedded in exports, plus emissions embedded in imports). If a country's consumption-based emissions are higher than its production emissions it is a net importer of carbon dioxide. Data has been converted by Our World in Data from million tonnes of carbon to million tonnes of CO2 using a conversion factor of 3.664.",Global Carbon Project
